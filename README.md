# vh-portfolio

## Description
This is my basic portfolio. This has the basic layout that I want to implement. I will insert my resume and projects once I have them polished. My portfolio consist of three pages: Home, Portfolio, and AboutMe. Each page displays a navbar and a footer. The styling of my site is basic, i will use bootstrap elements to improve that.
